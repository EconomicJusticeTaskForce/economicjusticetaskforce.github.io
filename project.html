                    <p>
                        On the morning of June 5, 2024, in Worcester, we are convening an event for alternative viewpoints and changing beliefs to address one of the most divisive topics within the field of sexual and domestic violence: sex work. Survivors, including those in recovery settings, need us to come to a deeper understanding of the complex intersection of sex work, survival sex, trafficking, and substance use. This forum will foster open dialogue, challenge preconceptions, and promote a deeper understanding of the nuanced realities of human trafficking, survival sex, sex work, and substance use.
                        More details and registration coming soon.
