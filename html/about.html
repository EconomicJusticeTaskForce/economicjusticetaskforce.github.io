                        We are a collaborative of local service providers, and our mission is to respond to the economic needs of survivors of domestic and sexual violence in Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, and Hampshire Counties. Our vision is to change our local economic system as we focus on assisting our neighbors in building safe, joyful, economically sustainable lives. We aim to inspire and support all who work on economic sustainability issues by sharing best practices and transformative ideas that integrate racial and social justice values and promote solutions that do not replicate the tools of domination, control, and abuse commonly found in too many of our systems.

                        <p>The Rural Economic Security Initiative of The Massachusetts Rural Domestic and Sexual Violence Project (MRSDVP) was created to address a reality that survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their advocates have long known—that economic security is necessary for survivor safety. Abusers cut off victims’ access to money, education, and employment, making it harder for them to leave and leaving them few options when they do, a situation exacerbated in rural areas by isolation, lack of affordable transportation, and limited job opportunities. In Massachusetts, where domestic violence is the leading cause of women’s homelessness, communities can no longer afford to treat violence and poverty as separate issues. Violence can jeopardize a person's economic well-being, leading to homelessness, unemployment, and interrupted education, while poverty increases the risks and intensifies the effects of violence. The Rural Economic Security Initiative aimed to respond to the economic needs of survivors of domestic and sexual violence in rural western Massachusetts to build a safer, stronger community.</p>
                        <p>The MRSDVP supported comprehensive services and advocacy for adult and adolescent survivors of domestic and sexual violence in 84 rural communities in Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden, and Worcester Counties. Funded through a grant from the Federal Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women, MRDSVP was a partnership between the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, four rural community-based sexual and domestic violence programs (New England Learning Center for Women in Transition, Elizabeth Freeman Center, Center for Women and Community of the University of Massachusetts, and Safe Passage), Jane Doe Inc., Hilltown Community Health Centers Inc., and the Northwestern and Berkshire County District Attorney’s Offices. MRDSVP’s mission was to reduce and eliminate domestic, dating, and sexual violence in rural Massachusetts by providing culturally relevant, accessible support and intervention to rural adult and adolescent survivors, as well as extensive domestic and sexual violence community education, engagement, and prevention initiatives. In addition, the project worked to improve the systemic response to violence through coordination of community coalitions, public awareness, and professional training to respond effectively to these issues.</p>

                            The early 2020s were a time of significant change. We had to adapt often as the COVID pandemic, shifts in staffing, funding cuts, and variations in other resources impacted our work. After a quiet period that allowed us to regain our bearings, we began the work of reinventing our group. In 2023, we renamed ourselves the Economic Justice Task Force of Western Massachusetts to reflect more precisely our mission, values, and focus. In addition, we embraced the opportunity to forgo our historical funding avenues so that we could be free to take a more radical approach to promoting economic justice.
